# GEV-NN-A-deep-neural-network-architecture-for-class-imbalance-problem-in-binary-classification

 This paper proposes a novel end-to-end deep neural network architecture and adopts Gumbel distribution as an activation function in neural networks for class imbalance problem in the application of binary classification. Our proposed architecture, named GEV-NN, consists of three components: the first component serves to score input variables to determine a set of suitable input, the second component is an auto-encoder that learns efficient explanatory features for the minority class, and in the last component, the combination of the scored input and extracted features are then used to make the final prediction. We jointly optimize these components in an end-to-end training. Extensive experiments using real-world imbalanced datasets showed that GEV-NN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by around 2% at most.
